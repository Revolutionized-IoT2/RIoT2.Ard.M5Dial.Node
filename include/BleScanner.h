// Wraps the M5Dial's on-chip BLE radio (via NimBLE-Arduino - NimBLEDevice/
// NimBLEScan/NimBLEScanCallbacks) to continuously discover nearby BLE
// advertisers in the background. NimBLE is used instead of the ESP32
// Arduino core's bundled Bluedroid BLE library because its host stack uses
// substantially less RAM - this M5Stamp-S3 module has no PSRAM, and
// WiFi + a Bluedroid BLE host together left only ~11-24KB of free heap,
// too little for M5GFX's PNG icon decoder to reliably allocate its working
// buffers. Like the on-device RFID reader (see main.cpp's
// rfidActive/M5Dial.Rfid pattern), the BLE radio is only powered on if the
// active configuration actually includes a view that wants BLE data
// (BLEView, see ViewManager::hasBleConsumer()) - it stays off otherwise,
// rather than being enabled unconditionally at boot.
//
// The underlying BLE stack invokes its scan-result callback from its own
// FreeRTOS task, not the Arduino loop() task, so results are handed off
// through a small mutex-guarded pending queue and only turned into
// onDeviceDiscovered()/onDeviceLost()/onAdvertisement() callbacks (and
// _devices list updates) from inside loop() - keeping all app-visible state
// single-threaded, consistent with the rest of this codebase (MQTT
// publish, view rendering, etc. all happen on the main loop() task).
//
// Continuous scanning is implemented with a dedicated low-priority
// background FreeRTOS task (see scanTask()) that repeatedly performs a
// *blocking* NimBLEScan::getResults(durationMs, false) call - blocking only
// that background task, never the Arduino loop() task. This deliberately
// avoids the alternative "non-blocking start() + onScanEnd that re-arms
// itself" pattern: that callback fires from inside the BLE stack's own
// event-processing task, and calling back into the scan-start APIs from
// there caused reproducible device resets shortly after the scanner
// started (confirmed with the original Bluedroid-based implementation) -
// recursing into the BLE stack from its own event-dispatch context is not
// a supported pattern (no bundled BLE example does this; they all call
// start()/getResults() from a separate task/loop instead).
